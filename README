Here is a README.md specifically designed to explain how to run the *Magical Arena* project from the command prompt/terminal, without the need for an IDE:

# Magical Arena

## Overview

Magical Arena is a simple console-based game in Java where two players, defined by their attributes (health, strength, and attack), fight in a turn-based battle. Players use dice rolls to determine attack and defense values, and the game continues until one player's health reaches zero.


## How to Run the Project

### 1. Download the Project

Download the project or clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>


### 2. Compile the Project

To compile the game, navigate to the src folder and run the following command:

bash
cd src
javac Main.java


This will compile all Java files and generate corresponding .class files.

### 3. Run the Game

Once the code is compiled, you can run the game with the following command:

bash
java Main




The game continues until one player dies, i.e., their health reaches zero.

### Notes

- Player with the lower health always attacks first.
- The damage is calculated as attack * dice roll, and the defense is calculated as strength * dice roll.
